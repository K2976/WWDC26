FLOW — macOS Cognitive Load & Focus Companion
Swift Student Challenge 2026
Built with Swift, SwiftUI, Swift Charts, CoreHaptics, AVFoundation
🧠 PROJECT OVERVIEW
Flow is a macOS app that visualizes cognitive load in real time — turning attention into something you can see, feel, and recover from.
Students often don’t realize how fragmented their attention has become until productivity collapses. Flow makes this invisible mental state visible through a living, reactive orb that responds instantly to distraction, overload, and calm.
Flow is not a productivity tracker.
It is a mirror for attention.
The app is intentionally calm, minimal, and premium — designed to feel unmistakably Apple-like. Every animation, sound, and interaction is purposeful. Nothing is noisy. Nothing is judgmental.
Within the first 10 seconds, a user should feel curiosity or calm.
🏗️ TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Language: Swift (latest)
UI Framework: SwiftUI only
Platform: macOS 26
Project Type: Xcode App Playground (.swiftpm)
Offline: 100% local — no networking or APIs
Allowed Frameworks:
SwiftUI, Swift Charts, AppKit (menubar), AVFoundation, CoreHaptics, Foundation, Combine / async-await
No third-party dependencies
Zipped size: under 25MB
Graceful degradation:
Menubar and haptics must fail silently if unsupported
🪟 APP SURFACES
1️⃣ Menubar Presence (Primary Identity)
Flow lives quietly in the macOS menubar as a tiny animated orb.
Menubar behavior:
Orb pulses continuously
Color and pulse speed reflect current cognitive load
Optional numeric score beside orb
Clicking opens a minimal popover (≈280×320pt)
Popover contents:
Larger animated orb
Current score
Human-readable state label
Tiny sparkline (last 10 minutes)
Three quick “Log Distraction” buttons
“Open Flow” button
Fallback behavior:
If menubar access is restricted by the playground sandbox:
App automatically switches to a floating, always-on-top panel
No crashes, no warnings
2️⃣ Full App Window (Main Experience)
A clean macOS window designed for focus:
Generous spacing
Dark, quiet backgrounds
No dense dashboards
Everything breathes
🎨 DESIGN SYSTEM (MINIMAL, APPLE-CENTRIC)
Reactive Color System
The entire UI shifts smoothly based on cognitive load score (0–100).
Score	State (Internal)	Display Label
0–25	calm	Calm
26–50	focused	In Flow
51–70	moderate	Busy
71–85	high	Scattered
86–100	overloaded	Overloaded
All color transitions animate over ~1.5–2s
No sudden jumps
Backgrounds remain subdued
The Focus Orb (Core Visual Identity)
The orb is always alive.
Its behavior changes with cognitive load:
Size increases slightly under stress
Pulse accelerates as load rises
Glow intensifies
Shape remains perfectly circular when calm
At high load, shape subtly distorts organically
At high load, small particles drift away from the surface
Implementation:
SwiftUI Canvas + TimelineView only. No SpriteKit.
Typography
SF Pro Rounded
Large, bold numerals for score
Soft, human language
Minimal labels
🧭 APP FLOW
Onboarding (First Launch Only — Tight & Fast)
Rules:
No long pauses
No blocking animations
Interaction available within 5 seconds
Flow:
Black screen
Orb fades in immediately and begins breathing
Single line of text:
“Your attention has a shape. Flow shows it to you.”
Prompt appears:
“How focused are you right now?”
Five glowing orb fragments (1–5)
Selection sets initial cognitive load and transitions directly into the dashboard.

History — 7-Day Focus Strip (Simplified)
Only last 7 days
Single horizontal row of rounded squares
Color reflects daily average load
Tap shows day summary
Minimal. Informative. No heavy analytics.
Smart Recovery Feature — Soft Reset
Appears automatically when score exceeds 85.
Behavior:
“Reset Attention” button appears
Triggers:
10-second guided breathing animation
Accelerated decay
Calm audio emphasis
No penalties
No stats
Flow helps recovery, not guilt.
🔢 COGNITIVE LOAD ENGINE
Score: Double (0–100)
Deterministic, local logic
Auto-decay every 30 seconds
Faster decay in Focus Mode
Hard caps at bounds
Smooth animated number transitions
History snapshots stored locally
Hardcoded values are intentional and experience-driven.
🔊 AUDIO & 📳 HAPTICS
Audio
Programmatically generated tones
Calm layer + stress layer
Smooth crossfade by load
Focus Mode uses calm only
Haptics
Orb pulse mirrored haptically
Event tap feedback
Focus Mode settling pattern
Disabled silently if unsupported
🧠 SCIENCE INSIGHTS
A curated set of real neuroscience insights about attention.
Shown:
On overload threshold
Via button
In session summary
Concise, trustworthy, and readable.
🎯 DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
Minimal
Calm
Sensory, not analytical
Apple-first
Experience over metrics
Recovery over judgment
Flow should feel like:
A mirror — not a manager.
🧾 FINAL NOTE
This app is intentionally restrained.
Nothing exists unless it improves understanding, calm, or clarity.
The goal is not to control attention —
it is to notice it.
