FLOW
macOS Cognitive Load & Focus Companion
Swift Student Challenge 2026
Built with Swift, SwiftUI, Swift Charts, CoreHaptics, AVFoundation
🧠 PROJECT OVERVIEW
Flow is a macOS app that visualizes cognitive load in real time — turning attention into something you can see, feel, and gently recover from.
Students often don’t realize how fragmented their attention has become until productivity collapses. Flow makes this invisible mental state visible through a living, reactive orb that responds instantly to distraction, overload, and calm.
Flow is not a productivity tracker.
It is a mirror for attention.
The experience is intentionally calm, minimal, and premium — designed to feel unmistakably Apple-like. Every animation, sound, and interaction is purposeful. Nothing is noisy. Nothing is judgmental.
Within the first 10 seconds, the app should evoke curiosity or calm.
🏗️ TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Language: Swift (latest)
UI Framework: SwiftUI only
Platform: macOS 26
Project Type: Xcode App Playground (.swiftpm)
Offline: 100% local — no networking or APIs
Allowed Frameworks:
SwiftUI, Swift Charts, AppKit (menubar), AVFoundation, CoreHaptics, Foundation, Combine / async-await
No third-party dependencies
Zipped size: under 25MB
Graceful degradation:
Menubar, keyboard shortcuts, and haptics must fail silently if unsupported
🪟 APP SURFACES
1️⃣ Menubar Presence (Primary Identity)
Flow lives quietly in the macOS menubar as a tiny animated orb.
Menubar behavior:
Orb pulses continuously
Color and pulse speed reflect current cognitive load
Optional numeric score beside orb
Clicking opens a minimal popover (~280×320 pt)
Popover contents:
Larger animated orb
Current score
Human-readable state label
Tiny sparkline (last 10 minutes)
Three quick “Log Distraction” buttons
“Open Flow” button
Fallback behavior:
If menubar access is restricted by the playground sandbox:
App automatically switches to a floating, always-on-top panel
No errors, warnings, or crashes
2️⃣ Full App Window (Main Experience)
A clean macOS window designed for focus:
Generous spacing
Dark, subdued backgrounds
Minimal controls
No dense dashboards
Everything should feel light, intentional, and calm.
🎨 DESIGN SYSTEM (MINIMAL, APPLE-CENTRIC)
Dynamic Color System (No Hard Hex Locking)
The UI color palette responds continuously to cognitive load (0–100) using smooth perceptual interpolation (HSB-style), not abrupt state jumps.
Score Range	Internal State	Display Label	Color Direction
0–25	calm	Calm	Deep blue
26–50	focused	In Flow	Indigo
51–70	moderate	Busy	Purple
71–85	high	Scattered	Orange
86–100	overloaded	Overloaded	Red
All transitions animate over ~1.5–2 seconds
No snapping between colors
Backgrounds remain dark and unobtrusive
The Focus Orb (Core Visual Identity)
The orb is always alive.
Its behavior evolves with cognitive load:
Subtle size increase as load rises
Faster pulse at higher load
Stronger glow under stress
Perfectly circular when calm
Slight organic distortion when overloaded
At high load, small particles drift away from the surface
Implementation:
SwiftUI Canvas + TimelineView only. No SpriteKit.
Typography
SF Pro Rounded
Large, bold numerals for score
Soft, human language
Minimal labeling
🧭 APP FLOW
Onboarding (First Launch Only — Tight & Fast)
Rules:
No long pauses
No blocking animations
Interaction available within 5 seconds
Flow:
Black screen
Orb fades in immediately and begins breathing
Single line of text:
“Your attention has a shape. Flow shows it to you.”
Prompt:
“How focused are you right now?”
Five glowing orb fragments (1–5)
Selection sets the initial cognitive load score and transitions directly into the dashboard.

⌨️ KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS (SANDBOX-SAFE)
Design Rule
Flow does not implement system-wide (global) keyboard shortcuts.
All shortcuts are local only and work only when Flow is active:
Main window focused
Menubar popover open
Floating panel active
Examples
Space → Log “Mind Wandered”
⌘1 / ⌘2 / ⌘3 → Log attention events
⌘F → Enter / exit Focus Mode
This approach is:
Sandbox-safe
Reliable
Predictable
Aligned with macOS privacy expectations
🎭 INTELLIGENT HARDCODING & IMPLICIT DEMO MODE
Flow is designed for a 3-minute judge evaluation window.
Core Principle
The app must show its full range of behavior immediately, without requiring long real-world sessions.
Strategy
1️⃣ Accelerated default behavior
Faster cognitive load ramp-up
Faster visible state transitions
Decay still present, but responsive
2️⃣ Quiet background simulation
On first launch:
The app may inject lightweight simulated events (e.g., a “notification” every ~15 seconds)
Smoothly increases load so judges can see:
Color shifts
Orb distortion
Particle effects
Graph activity
3️⃣ Pre-populated history
The 7-day focus strip is filled with believable mock data on first launch
Makes the app feel lived-in and complete
4️⃣ Simulation fades out
As soon as the user:
Logs real events
Starts a focus session
Interacts meaningfully
The app hands over full control.
Simulation is never labeled or exposed in UI.
🧘 FOCUS MODE (TRANSFORMATIONAL)
Triggered via toggle.
Transition:
All UI fades except orb
Orb expands smoothly using matched geometry
Audio shifts to calm
Haptics slow or disable if unsupported
Focus Mode UI:
Orb becomes breathing guide (4-7-8)
Soft “Breathe” text fades in/out
Circular timer ring
One button: “Log Distraction”
Minimal text only
Session end:
Gentle chime
Orb pulses gold
Automatic transition to summary
🌱 SMART RECOVERY FEATURE — Soft Reset
Appears automatically when score exceeds 85.
Behavior:
“Reset Attention” button appears
Triggers:
10-second guided breathing animation
Accelerated decay
Calm audio emphasis
No penalties
No stats
Flow helps recovery, not guilt.

🎯 DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
Minimal
Calm
Sensory, not analytical
Apple-first
Experience over metrics
Recovery over judgment
Flow should feel like:
A mirror — not a manager.
🧾 FINAL NOTE
Nothing exists unless it improves clarity, calm, or understanding.
The goal is not to control attention —
it is to notice it.
